GITT TODO
=========

[1]  Since when multiple commits are pulled from the same pack, some commit objects will be compressed into ofs_delta objects.
     Currently, our protocol does not implement the parsing of ofs_delta objects, so the commits we obtain may be incomplete.
     In order to solve this problem, the next best thing is to set the parent of the commit to empty. That is to say, we do
     not keep the history record. Each new commit will always be the first commit in the repository.
     Of course, this also has a side effect, that is, one repository can only be provided to one device.
